          <p>Faraz Khalid - &nbsp;His 90 days reign at noon</p><p><br></p><p>After reading so many negative comments about&nbsp;noon&nbsp;and its new CEO I thought it would only be right to give a more balanced view of what he has manged to achieve in only 3 months.</p><p><br></p><p>On hiring and Culture.</p><p>It has been well documented that as soon as the new CEO joined he gave Omar the green light to do whatever he wants in the Tech and Product teams.&nbsp; We all know what then happened to the highly talented teams which had taken over 12 months to hire from around the world (all fired). During the mass lay off Omar disagrees with Faraz and then decides that the gig is a little too tough for him so he leaves the company.&nbsp; As soon as he is out the door, Faraz starts spreading rumours and dissing him in front of his old team, and then some of them decided to join him in his new venture esanjo</p><p><br></p><p>After the initial layoffs, Faraz stands in front of 400 people at his ‘town hall’ presentation (which I have on good account, was one of the most un-inspiring motivational speeches ever witnessed) and told them that there were to be no more headcount reductions.&nbsp;&nbsp;One week later&nbsp;the complete management team in the warehouse are told to leave the company.&nbsp; (Apparently this was a better ‘town hall’ meeting that the previous one, where he gets lambasted by the commercial team, and begs the team to "trust him" and "believe him” when they doubt the new business plan.</p><p><br></p><p>He has done a great job of hiring and maintaining the great diversity in the teams in all areas of the business.&nbsp; Up to now around 90% of the new hires are from India (no disrespect) but he has thrown everything the previous team has done off the window. Moreover, his close friends with little knowledge and experience now head up the various remaining departments he butchered.&nbsp; RC heading logistics who never worked a day in the UAE, KM in the warehouse &nbsp;and CS (why not combine 2 departments? it makes perfect sense) previously heading CS at Namshi with no priors in fulfilment operations and AM heading content and catalogue (graduated in 2010) previously a category manager at Wadi and customer service exec at Etisalat (talk about capability &amp; Ivy leagues he continuously brags about) which btw up until yesterday she steered a major screw up in content where only 5,000 out of the 250,000+ were showing up live.&nbsp; Oh, and while on the subject of India – he opens an office there under a different name (limestone I believe) not associated withnoon, - dig a little deeper and I'm sure there is something very fishy going on there.</p><p><br></p><p>He has done a great job in transforming the culture in the company, to one where people are either waiting to be fired (you may have seen a little website which went viral last week) or have just had enough and decide to the leave (Head of HR, more to come watch this space).&nbsp; I heard that the warehouse had a good culture, which took a year to build, but his team of experts headed up by some guy was destroyed within a couple of weeks of his expert team running it.&nbsp; (I suppose it does not come as a surprise given that he has only had a couple of years of Customer Service experience at Namshi – with no operational background at all).</p><p><br></p><p>Oh, and a little-known fact is that during Ramadan the&nbsp;noon&nbsp;Warehouse apparently was asked to do Namshi volumes because they were breaking and apparently&nbsp;in 3 weeks&nbsp;did a better result than what Namshi did&nbsp;in 5 years. It's a shame that Namshi folks are now running it.&nbsp; Faraz had kept the management team on board until they were done and fired them straight after... speaks volume of his character.</p><p><br></p><p>Apparently Faraz can't wait for the day&nbsp;noon&nbsp;is launched so he can remove the gloss from the windows and people are going to look inside and have envy when they see the buzz... they will be jealous and line up to be part of this organization.&nbsp; What a great vison for being an employer of choice in the region, I am sure all the top talent will be forming an orderly queue to join given the culture that he has created over the last 90 odd days.</p><p><br></p><p>Technology</p><p>Back in April, the App was ready and approved in the app store, the warehouse had already inbounded &gt;200k units of stock, and gone through weeks of outbound testing, CS team was in place and finishing the final testing on the system, and the logistics system was also finished with the testing of the last mile operations.&nbsp; But due to all his vast experience Faraz knew that what had been built from the ground up was the wrong approach (and he had sanctioned the firing of all the people who had built it).&nbsp; So he depreciated all the systems that had been built and tested, and decided to go with……well he was not sure but he knew a few companies in India who have some off the shelf products which would offer no competitive advantage, so he popped to India and bought some systems – which are going to be the enablers of&nbsp;noon’s amazing customer experience that everyone is expecting.&nbsp; Anyway – the systems were late and the warehouse needed to inbound products ready for the&nbsp;August 15&nbsp;launch, so currently the systems and stock are being managed on good old google sheets……..Now that is cutting edge.&nbsp; He is humble, and had no problem with pleading with some of the fired Tech and Product teams to come back and help him out when he realised that he had no talent left in the team, but unfortunately, they replied with their middle finger.&nbsp; Faraz has tenacity, and these small set-backs did not stop him pushing ahead with the app and website development.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he calls himself a coder and bragged about it endlessly to everyone he met when he joined – he did not have a clue what to do (he actually did not write a single line since he joined... the guy is that inspiring) so it is a good job that he kept in the good books of Hisham Zarka (co founder and MD at Namshi) as he is now working full time at noon as Faraz was not able to work out what to do (obviously Faraz doesn't want a single person to know that Zarka is there practically 24 hours building the tech stack... he goes by the alias Tom).</p><p><br></p><p>Selection &amp; Customer Experience.</p><p>There was a lot of hype of&nbsp;noon&nbsp;launching with 20 million products, a lot of which would be available for delivery&nbsp;within 3 hours.&nbsp; Unfortunately, again Faraz, is not one to be throwing money into stock (noon&nbsp;is a shop after all).&nbsp; So what will be the ground-breaking customer proposition&nbsp;noon&nbsp;will be launching with after all this wait and anticipation in the market………..Well about 200k SKU’s (most of which are going to be picked from other company’s warehouses, shipping intonoon, packaged and then sent via Aramex on to the customers.&nbsp; What about the ultra fast delivery I hear you ask, well Faraz thinks it is a waste of money, and customers do not really want to have fast delivery. So it will be 5 days delivery, or until the customer cancels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Noon&nbsp;had also developed a market leading aftersales and returns policy together with its own fleet for the last mile delivery, again this was expensive (not sure if I have mentioned that Faraz is a very cheap CEO who does not like to spend money…..or pay anyone who has provided stock or a service to the company, therefore he scrapped all of that, no more 3 attempts of delivery, Keep attempting delivery till customer cancels the order.&nbsp; However, he has made a big improvement in the cost structure of the logistics and due to the amount of trust he has in the logistics team, the delivery associates are to keep cash and failed deliveries with them till next day.&nbsp; (saves on overtime and bringing the cash back to the operations)</p><p>If you think he is just going to launch with the regular ‘non-food’ categories then you would be wrong, he is going to launch with food and FMCG which is great news.&nbsp; Yes he will deliver the order to union coop&nbsp;(he smartly happened to choose one of the most expensive on the shelf customer propositions who will go around their shops and pick the order, and then hand it over to the last mile operation – again another game changer for the region, however I am not sure how the availability will be as there is not stock file for each of the shops so I hope he has built in a robust replacement recommendation engine…..not (as per Faraz this is not important, this can be filled on good old excel sheets).</p><p><br></p><p>The revised business plan had a lot of the selection coming from back to back orders from other re-sellers in the region that he promised the commercial team he will sign on (actually that was his only deliverable, other than delivering the tech stack which he handed over to Zarka), however he has not been able to sign any of them ( except for&nbsp;<a data-cke-saved-href="http://sivvi.com/" href="http://sivvi.com/" target="_blank">Sivvi.com</a>; gee I wonder why) as they see him and&nbsp;noon&nbsp;as a bit of a joke and do not want to be associated with the company.&nbsp;</p><p>I am sure you will agree that with these changes,&nbsp;noon&nbsp;will be living up to the hype of changing the way people will shop very soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Commercial</p><p>During his ‘town hall’ meetings in April– Faraz openly put the reason for the previous failure to launch at the doorstep of the Commercial team, as there was not the selection that was promised.&nbsp; He was correct as it was well known that all other functions were tested and ready, it was just that there was no stock in the shop.&nbsp; Strange how Faraz then went of a firing spree with every department who were ready and completely left the commercial team in place.&nbsp; That said, initially Faraz wanted to fire the head of Commercial (Tarik) as soon as he joined but he realized that Tarik could be a puppet and he is now very happy he is on-board.</p><p>It is not all one way, and Tarik is also very happy as he has a new mentor and does whatever he can to emulate him.&nbsp; Faraz runs about in the office – Tarik runs about in the office.&nbsp; Faraz takes his shoes off in the office – Tarik now walks about in the office barefoot.&nbsp; When Faraz has a cold or the flu – yes you guessed it, Tarik suddenly comes down with a bout of flu.&nbsp;</p><p>Tarik is very particular of how people pronounce his name and just to get the message across he sent out a universal message to all his team (not to get there stuff together to avoid another failed launch) but to make sure they call him Tarik with a K.</p><p>Faraz wants the most un-inspiring people around him and the commercial team of 40+ people are complaining every day with no one to listen anymore. &nbsp;(Well unless they ring the bell which is to signify that there is going to be ANOTHER commercial meeting).</p><p>What about the seller platform I hear you ask – well that is not ready yet, apparently the sellers will be getting training on how to use the platform on the same day the site goes live – assuming it will be on&nbsp;August 15.</p><p>Working in the commercial team is not all that bad, they have a unique way of motivating the team.&nbsp; Anyone who does not hit their weekly target will get a warning, and If you receive three warnings, you will be fired, but the really motivating part is if you DO hit your target, Tarik will ring the bell.&nbsp; What true leadership, although the bell is not ringing that much at the moment.</p><p><br></p><p>Leadership……</p><p>Faraz loves to hustle, and keeps asking everyone to show this unique leadership trait, hence running around the office to get to that meeting just a bit quicker than if you walked to it.&nbsp; That said Faraz never turns up to the office before 10,30 (and this is after he sent out a message to all the company begging them to ‘please turn up to work on time’.&nbsp; He is forward thinking though, and now as a company perk, employees who work after&nbsp;8.00pm&nbsp;can now get their dinner paid for by the company.&nbsp; He does some great stand up meetings with all the office, the subject of which are usually Faraz, and how great he is, oh and the investors in&nbsp;noon.&nbsp; He talks about loving to be challenged, however when anyone does – he storms out of the meeting.&nbsp; Although Face time is not allowed in the UAE, Faraz has managed to install it in the company culture and people have to stay late even if there is nothing for them to do, no one should leave before&nbsp;9.00pm&nbsp;and if you are thinking of leaving you should ask others in the office ‘is there something I can do for you and stay a bit later’?</p><p>He also loves to have a game of cricket, and ping pong, which is a little distracting for the rest of the people in the office, who are trying to get stuff done.&nbsp; That said it is a shame that he does not even know the people in the teams, does not say good morning to any of them, and has not trusted anyone in the company to test the new app.</p><p><br></p><p>Vison</p><p>Noon&nbsp;was started with a clear vison of quality and changing the game in the Middle East.&nbsp; The previous CEO was passionate about delivering a great customer experience in all parts of the business and he hired some amazing talent both locally and from around the world.&nbsp; Yes the plug was pulled on the launch but why would you then come in and turn everything off that was built over the last 12 months, to replace it with sub-standard components, and sub-standard talent from a local competitor?&nbsp; Was he scared of the talent and did not understand what had been built for scale?&nbsp; Faraz has managed to turnnoon&nbsp;into a joke in the region, forget about competing with Souq and Amazon,&nbsp;noon&nbsp;will struggle to compete with……..well anyone.&nbsp; All he needed to do was to understand what he had, and then work on the selection, but his ego was too big, and he just needed to do what he could understand, which is why it will look like a copy and paste of Namshi.</p><p>Noon&nbsp;was a great opportunity to put the Middle East on the map of e-commerce, however all it has achieved is to destroy people, burn capital, and become a joke.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To all the people who have been shown the door in the last three months without so much as a thankyou.&nbsp; You built something which&nbsp;would&nbsp;have changed the way people shop, and you should be very proud of that.</p><p><br></p><p>Well done Faraz – you have demonstrated great HUSTLE to get all this done&nbsp;in 3 months, looking forward to the 15th&nbsp;J</p>
